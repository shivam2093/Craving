the software has written when the employer gives the work. If we hired someone to make software in the company, that software belongs to the developer, not the employer. However, In some cases, the employer is considered the legal owner who owns the copyright. For example, if the company hires an employee to create a new database for the company record, then the corporation will own the copyright in their work. If the work is specially commissioned, it means if the person paying for the software owns the software copyright.

b) 

1) The time when employees work for their company is their property. Companies generally buying employee time and use employee code.
In the US, every state has a different rule on copyright. Generally, when you left the company, there are no sources we can reuse in the future except if you stored somewhere, but If they give their property to use, it comes under them.

2) company A, which owns copyright by the company, then it is difficult to get from them, and such things are considered in company, which is done by HR at the time of on-board. Thus, if the copyright already consents with the employee, the employee can use the company B source.

3) As we know that every company in the IT market has competed with others. For example, Coco-cola Never discloses its recipe or formula to people. However, when we started a startup company after learning from a previous company, we make sure that company policies, pattern, designs, methods, or practices should not become evident to others and used for the company purpose only, which we can be called 'classified document' in Business language.

C.  when an Independent contractor works done and gives the project to the client, and there is nothing disclose about who owns what, then both parties may assume anything. for example, if an Independent contractor never explicitly stated in writing and assigned agreement, then it can lead to confusion. so, creating derivatives for the work done by the creator or independent contractor then copyright will be retained with them.
